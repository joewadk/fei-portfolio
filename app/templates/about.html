                    <h3>My Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently a computer science student and MLH Fellow, passionate about software
                        engineering and building impactful technology solutions. My journey in programming
                        started in high school when I built my first website, and since then, I've been
                        fascinated by the power of code to solve real-world problems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As an MLH Fellow, I'm gaining hands-on experience in production engineering,
                        working on open source projects, and collaborating with talented developers
                        from around the world. This program has been instrumental in developing my
                        technical skills and understanding of software development best practices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new places, taking photographs,
                        or gaming. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and
                        finding inspiration from diverse experiences.
